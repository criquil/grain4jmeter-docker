# grain4jmeter-docker
Docker container for Grafana &amp; InfluxDB for JMeter.

Inspired by https://github.com/sarkershantonu/jmeter-grafana-influxdb-docker but changed to have both Grafana and InfluxDB in the same image. Purpose of this image is testing and demos. It doesn't save anything and you can just start the container and point JMeter to it and see what is there to see.
